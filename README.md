# Disease-Prediction-from-medical-data
This repository is about the model that makes prediction what kind of disease an individual is suffering or facing.


A machine learning-based disease prediction system that uses symptoms to predict possible diseases. The model utilizes an ensemble approach combining Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest Classifier for accurate predictions.
